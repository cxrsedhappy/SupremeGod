# 🐍 SupremeGod

SupremeGod is a console-based "Snake" game created as an environment for training artificial intelligence (AI) using the Q-Learning algorithm.

The environment is built based on prototypes of real game frameworks: all functions are documented, the code is modular, and variables are encapsulated for ease of expansion and training.
